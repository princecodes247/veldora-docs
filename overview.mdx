## Setting up Veldora

Let's get started with the setup process, which is a breeze:

- Step 1: Create Your First Bucket
  The first step is to create a bucket, which acts as a container for your form data. To do this, log in to your Veldora account and head to the Dashboard. Click on the "Create New Bucket" button, and you're on your way to building your data collection!

- Step 2: Integrate with Your Frontend
  Once you've created a bucket, Veldora generates a unique API endpoint for it. Copy the provided API endpoint and integrate it into your frontend form action. No complex configurations needed; it's that simple!

### Make it Yours

Veldora offers powerful customization options to match your brand and project requirements:

Customize Styling
Personalize your forms to align with your company's colors and branding. Tailor the look and feel to make your forms seamlessly blend with your website's design.

Analyze User Interactions
Utilize Veldora's built-in analytics feature to gain valuable insights into user interactions with your forms. Understand user behavior, track form submissions, and enhance your user experience.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
