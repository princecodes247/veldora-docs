## Setting up Veldora

Let's get started with the setup process, which is a breeze:

### Step 1: Create Your First Bucket

The first step is to create a bucket, which acts as a container for your form data. To do this, log in to your Veldora account and head to the Dashboard. Click on the "Create New Bucket" button, and you're on your way to building your data collection!

### Step 2: Integrate with Your Frontend

Once you've created a bucket, Veldora generates a unique API endpoint for it. Copy the provided API endpoint and integrate it into your frontend form action. No complex configurations needed; it's that simple!

### Make it Yours

Veldora offers powerful customization options to match your brand and project requirements:
